# pyirclib
pyirclib is a pure Python3-based IRC client that supports DCC file transfers as
well as anonymization of identity. For example, it contains a list of commonly
used DCC VERSION responses and their respective frequencies and can connect to
an IRC server randomly selecting one of them (while maintaining the correct
ratio, i.e, common IRC clients will be chosen more commonly). It also will
generate nicknames automatically that "look" right.

It's a project that has been written a fairly long time ago and isn't well
maintained by me anymore.

## Dependencies
pyirclib requires Python 3.10 or above.

## License
GNU GPL-3.
